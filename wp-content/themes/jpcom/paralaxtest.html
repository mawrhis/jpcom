			Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. "I am going with you! " he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. "Take me, too."

			"There!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. "Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!"</p>

			But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.

			"Drive on!" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.

			"Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.

			But the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.

			"Well, you are a fellow," Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.

			After a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, "Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?"

			"You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now," Ivan snaped sullenly.

			Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.

			"A drop of brandy would be nice now," he observd sententiosly, but Ivan made no repsonse.

			"You shall have some, too, when we get home."

			Ivan was still silent.

			Fyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.

			"But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor."

			Ivan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.</p>
